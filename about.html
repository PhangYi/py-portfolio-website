                        <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
                        <p style="color: white">I am currently at the age of 19. I am taking diploma in Multimedia Design in Tunku Abdul Rahman University of Management and Technology. Now, I am one year and three semesters into my diploma.<br>
                        <br>
                        I am from a family of five, with both my loving parents, and two other siblings. I have been inspired with the creativity of this world. I am always thrilled to explore new topics under creativity, always so ready to learn more. Hence, I am currently taking this course in hope to improve and enhance my skills, hope that I can learn how to express my own creativity too and show to other people around this world. I hope to make an impact, even the slightest. I hope that my name and artworks get the recognition that I’ve hope for.<br> 
                        <br>
                        I always thought that I am an introverted person but apparently I am not. I like to meet new people yet I don’t really know how to keep a conversation going or to stay in touch without sounding creepy or weird. I tend to overthink a lot too. Besides all that, I am too a bit “OCD.” Sometimes, I could take hours to correct the smallest details of the project I am working on just to satisfy my inner perfectionist. Even if the result may not be visible, at least I won’t turn in something that I am annoyed and not satisfy with.</p>

                    <br>
                    <div class="bio">
                        <h1>What is My Goals?</h1>
                        <p style="color: white">I have a few personal goals, and I will be sharing some here:<br>
                        <br>
                        1. I hope that my name, my brand, and my artworks can be spread and widely known. In order for me to make that goal happens, I must practice and enhance my skills every day. Fame doesn’t just miraculously gifted to me, so I need to work hard instead. Comparing the current me with the past me, and not with others. <br>
                        <br>
                        2. I hope to work with some loyal clients and even big companies. I will update my portfolio often each time I created something new. Being consistent is the key here so that my clients will have trust in my skills and efficiency when doing my work. There are a few companies that I have my eyes on, which are miHoYo and Riot. A few artists I’ve looked up since I was young which are Jaiden and Jazza.<br>
                        <br>
                        3. I hope the refine and improve on other aspects of art other than just illustration, like photography, modeling, animation, coding and character designing. Having multiple skills can be helpful for a client too, I can reduce the amount of people they need to hired.</p>
